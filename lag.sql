Carnival

[Verse 1: Anthony Hamilton]
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go home again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing
Keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
I hear the music in the background
Singing, singing

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
Oh, I haven't see the glory
Coming, coming, coming
And we play
We play, we play, we play like a-

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & Choir]
Just like a carnival
Game, just like a carnival
Laugh, just like a carnival
Joke, just like a-
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival

[Verse 2: Anthony Hamilton]
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend the time with you
Doing nothing

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & Choir]
We, just like a carnival
We laughed, just like a carnival
Sleep with the dead, just like a carnival
Playing with your mind, jJust like a-
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival, yeah"),
("Ascension", "155", "[Intro: Vince Staples]
You are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova
Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up?
Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told ya
They tryna dinosaur us
So now it's time to go up

[Chorus: Vince Staples & The Humanz Choir]
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
The roof is on fire
She wet like Barbra Streisand
Police everywhere
It's like a nigga killed a white man
I just wanna find a baby mama 'fore the night end
So don't be coming 'round Vince
On that batter ram shit
On that 911 shit
Need a misses brown as Missy
I can have some fun with
Them slave bones make Grace Jones
Don't stop, bitch, stay focused
They hated on us since days of Moses
Let my people go crazy
Them stars falling, don't chase 'em

[Chorus: Vince Staples & The Humanz]
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

[Verse 2: 2D]
Attack on Iraq
It's on a line
Typing it fast
Then it's slipping my mind
Oh, when I'm drunk
I'm spirited back
I fall in a fire then I save myself
Then I get advantage
'Cause the feeling's so raw
In these times of sedition
Well, nothing is dull
And I'm moving into stillness
And recalling it all
And I’m a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a-

[Chorus: Vince Staples & The Humanz]
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
All these liberated women sitting in my lap
I'm finna catch a body like I got a gun and badge
I'm finna turn Obama to my patna 'fore he dash
Pull up to the pad, wipe my ass with the flag
I'm just playing, baby, this the land of the free
Where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap
Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree
(Aghh!)

[Chorus: Vince Staples & The Humanz]
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)"),

New shit, new Kung Fu Kenny

[Verse 1]
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close—get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My mama told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—

[Chorus]
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 2]
Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
Yeah, that's the business
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me Black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth
Said know my worth
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed
I know he walks the Earth
But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah
Zeroes to flip, temptation is, yah
First on my list, I can't resist, yah
Everyone together now, know that we forever—

[Chorus]
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'

Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'

Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us

[Chorus: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
(Another world premiere!)
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin’ lovely, livin' lovely

If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I’d rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy, I got somethin'
Hol' up, we gon' function, no assumptions
Feelin' like Tyson with it
Knock it out twice, I’m with it
Only for the night, I’m kiddin'
Only for life, you’re a homie for life
You're a homie for life, let's get it
Hit that shoulder lean
I know what comin' over mean
Backstroke oversea
I know what you need
Already on ten, our money come in
All feeling go out, this feeling don’t drought
This party won't end

If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?

I'm on the way
We ain't got no time to waste
Poppin' your gum on the way
Am I in the way?
I don't wan' pressure you none
I want your blessing today
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Damn it, we jammin'
Bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like an exit away, yep

("DNA.", "185", "[Verse 1]
I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don’t contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin’ in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you
This is Paula’s oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on-sale motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power’s here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge]
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman—a blind woman—pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watchin' her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? "Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it." She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost... your life."

[Bridge: Bēkon]
Is it wickedness?

[Outro]
Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: "And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'…"
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it.")
